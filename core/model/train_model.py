ðŸ“Œ **Notes: Understanding the STAR Model (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF)**
==============================================================

### What This Model Does**
- This model predicts whether a given sentence follows the **STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method**.
- It uses **Logistic Regression**, a classification algorithm, trained on labeled sentences (`1` = STAR, `0` = Not STAR).
- Input text is **converted into numerical features** using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown**
#### **A. Data Preparation**
- The dataset `star_data.txt` contains labeled sentences (`sentence | label` format).
- `load_data()` reads this file, and `preprocess_data()`:
  - Converts labels (`1` or `0`) to integers.
  - Drops any missing values.

#### Feature Extraction (TF-IDF)**
- Textual data is converted into a numerical format using **TF-IDF**:
  - **TF (Term Frequency):** How often a word appears in a document.
  - **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):** Reduces the importance of words that appear frequently across all documents.
  - The result is a **sparse matrix representation** of sentences.

#### Model Training (Logistic Regression)**
- **Why Logistic Regression?**
  - A simple yet powerful **binary classification** model.
  - Outputs a probability score between **0 and 1** for STAR classification.
- The model is trained on:
  - **X_train (TF-IDF sentence vectors)**
  - **y_train (STAR labels: 1 or 0)**

#### Model Evaluation**
- The dataset is split into **80% training / 20% testing
- Accuracy is calculated on the test set:
  ```python
  accuracy = model.score(X_test_vectorized, y_test)
